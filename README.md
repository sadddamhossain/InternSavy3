# Customer Segmentation Analysis with Python
Certainly, here are the high-level steps to build a customer segmentation model using K-means clustering:

1. **Load Data**: Load your customer data into a DataFrame.

2. **Data Preprocessing** (if needed):
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., 'Gender') into numerical format.
   - Standardize or normalize numerical features.

3. **Select Features**: Choose the relevant features for segmentation (e.g., 'Age' and 'Annual Income').

4. **Determine Optimal Clusters**:
   - Use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
   - Plot the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against different values of K.
   - Choose the value of K where the rate of decrease in WCSS starts to slow down (the "elbow" point).

5. **Perform K-means Clustering**:
   - Initialize the K-means algorithm with the chosen value of K.
   - Fit the model to your data.
   - Assign each data point to a cluster.

6. **Analyze the Clusters**:
   - Examine the characteristics of each cluster (e.g., by calculating mean values for each feature within each cluster).
   - Interpret the clusters to understand customer segments.

7. **Visualize the Results**:
   - Create scatter plots or other visualizations to display the clusters.
   - Optionally, annotate data points with relevant information.
